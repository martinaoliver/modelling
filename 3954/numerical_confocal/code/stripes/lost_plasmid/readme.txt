- findpeaks.py finds peaks with find_peak python package and saves results into
a pkl file containins parID of stripped and non stripped parIDs for each regime
(4 regimes: growth x boundary)

- findpeaks.ypnb does the same job but slower (as it is a jupyter notebook). It
also creates pieplots with frequency of patterning and frequency of each
patterning mechanism
