    Function for representing a Newton-Raphson iteration for multidimensional systems of equations

        - numDims(): Method that returns an integer number of variables in the system of equations
        - getJacobian(np.ndarray): Method to compute the Jacobian of the system of equations at the current root estimate.The output is an n by n matrix where n is the number of variables in the system of equations
		- __call__(np.ndarray): Method to make this class act like a function operating on some input x
    :param x_guess: an initial guess for the Newton-Raphson iteration
    :param max_num_iter: a maximum number of iterations that will be taken
    :param tolerance: a tolerance that will stop the sequence once the error drops below it
    :param alpha: A coefficient that can tune the Newton-Raphson stepsize. Recommend setting alpha <= 1.
